I've done this multiple times over and over again, each time unsatisfied with my product; I didn't like the design, or the system/structure which was often poorly created and inefficient, and so on and so forth. So I kept at it! And each time I got better. I knew I wouldn't be able to finish like the entire scope of what this project could be in 2 months (even now that I have a 9-5), but I still wanted to create a base where I can build off of. This is that base. I focused on the very essential parts, and left the others to the future me to try out, if I'm still up to it.

Through this web application, you can schedule an appointment and view that appointment. On the business end, you can view the appointments that have been created and modify them. 

When working in a group project, I learned that React was a very helpful library used in web development. I had heard of it when it was mentioned, but I never paid much attention to it because I was using Python's Flask (via Harvard's CS50). If only I knew. React is legitimately a life saver, it made life so much easier. Using React forced me to learn about new things as well (like Webpack).

This project also led to me developing a form checking system, which I'm actually very proud of. I've always struggled with checking input because I often approached it in an inefficient way, I wanted to avoid using regexes, and honestly, I just didn't know as much as I know now (not that I know everything under the sun). This system makes my life a lot easier, the only annoying thing is having to configure the requirements because who wants to type when you can program? That did not make sense. Anyway, I think this is best explained through pictures, so have at it (to the nonexistent person reading this, naturally).

The pictures end up being reversed here, so the picture right after this message is the last picture I took.

Anyway, I kind of like web developing on both the front- and back-end. The front-end allowed me to express any creativity I had in the page design, and the back--end challenged me to make better systems. I know for a fact that my code could be better, but I'm not as experienced and versed in the world of programming as I wish I could be. But I'm working on it! The current design got its inspiration from Next.JS and its stupendous website. I was legitimately staring at that website for a week straight, it looked so pleasant to me.

One thing I liked seeing was how much the page designs have improved throughout time. As I mentioned, this isn't my first time attempting to make a good web page. And fortunately, I've been able to keep record of my previous attempts, in order for me to dog pile on said previous attempts, naturally.

Here is a previous version of the web page. I would get the older ones, but I don't feel like doing that right now as I would have to download them, and attempt to get them to run. No thank you.

There's a VIN decoder, wherever there's a VIN asking to be entered, there's something in place to decode that VIN so that the make/model/year of said vehicle will automatically load.

There's a slight bug with the bookmarking, I'm not sure what's going on there or how to get the debug to run on VS Code as I am doing "nodemon server.js", and not running a file. The bug in question is that when you click it, nothing will happen, but when you refresh, you'll see that something did actually happen. I'm so tired of working on this project to be honest, I'm going to accept it and maybe work on it down the road.

It's pretty late and I don't feel like writing either, so yeah! Thank you Lysandra for getting this done, and I hope we can make an even better system. Another issue I have is that I am unable to build upon something I don't like, I'll just start anew. I feel the same way already, unfortunately. It's not perfect, so I want to just scrap it and start over, but I can't do that because I am mortal and I don't have an unlimited amount of time in life. One thing I'll be keeping is the Form Check system though, that is my prized possession!
