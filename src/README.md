I've done this multiple times over and over again, each time unsatisfied with my product. I didn't like the design, or the system/structure was bad and inefficient, and so on and so forth. So I kept at it! And each time I got better. I knew I wouldn't be able to finish like the entire scope of what this project could be in 2 months (even now that I have a 9-5), but I still wanted to create a base where I can build off of. This is that base. I focused on the very essential parts, and left the others to the future me to try out, if I'm still up to it.
